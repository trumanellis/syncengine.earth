# 🌿 TEMPLES OF REFUGE 🌿

***A Portal into the Synchronicity Engine’s Sacred Gifting Economy***

Temples of Refuge is the nonprofit organization charged with administering the sacred gifting economy of the Synchronicity Engine. 

Members are admitted through recommendation by two existing members of the community. 

Once initiated, members have access to a network of land-based Temples around the planet. 

Temples host spiritual Gatherings of the Tribe where local community can gather in co-created worship of the Divine, however that looks to them. 

As a 508c1a religious nonprofit registered in Utah, these gatherings qualify for religious protections and first amendment rights within the United States. 

At the end of every gathering, exchange of gifts and Tokens of Gratitude takes place, a kind of sacred market. 

Here, accumulated Tokens of Gratitude, earned via Acts of Service throughout the week may be traded for goods and services, also donated to the community. 

The interface is dead simple. Suppose you have set up a stall to give away delicious baked goods and I walk up with eyes of delight at the beauty of your creation. 

You'd love to share a piece of cake with everyone at this gathering but there's got to be at least a hundred people here, so you've got to find the subset who would most appreciate your goods. 

Besides, you're not the only one who brought food and some people came to the market with other interests, a jar of homegrown herbs perhaps. 

So I walk up to you with the biggest smile, trying to decide between raw food brownies or cheesecake. 

You recommend the maracuja cheesecake and I decide that's what I really want so I open up Sync Engine on my phone and create an Intention: “Delicious cheesecake".

The next screen prompts me to attach Tokens of Gratitude to the intention so I drag over the one I earned last week for helping my neighbor cut and process invasive eucalyptus on his land.

I save the intention and am rewarded a little card displaying the Intention and a QR code which you can scan to view and fulfill the Intention — by giving me a big slice of maracuja cheesecake. 

My phone buzzes with a notification, you've posted a Proof of Service and I am encouraged to release my Eucalyptus Token into your stewardship. 

The deal is done and now we're also automatically connected through Sync Engine so I can make a special request next time.

And maybe you'll get one one of those pizzas you smell baking two stalls down... 

It does take resources to maintain Sync Engine, so monthly donations/tithes are encouraged to allow the ecosystem to evolve.

But being a nonproft, Temples of Refuge will need to redistribute funds back to the community on a regular basis.

This will follow a similar model to the maracuja cheesecake, find the most grateful recipients within the community via a gratitude bidding system. 

At every new moon, a notifications would fly out to all members alerting them that $xxx,xxx amount of dollars would be going back to the community and inviting members to bid their service-earned Tokens of Gratitude for a piece of the pie proportional to the time-weight of those tokens. 

Remember that Gratitude is measured in hours of accumulated collective attention on an Intention and that by helping out with high-gratitude Intentions will reward you with a higher value Tokens of Gratitude and thus, a bigger piece of the pie. Or maracuja cheesecake. 

So if I bid Tokens worth 111 hours and you bid 333 hours, you’ll get a slice that’s 3 times bigger than mine, refunded back to our accounts via whatever payment method has been enabled for monthly donations. 

Of course, some expense needs be spent by the organization in order to keep things running ; servers must be bought, developers contracted with, system expanded, new lands bought for the benefit of the community, Temples popping up everywhere.

Do you see yourself living in this kind of future reality? 

Does this feel familiar in some way?

Does it remind you of the the future?

If so, please make whatever donation feels appropriate to reserve a spot as one of the Original Stewards of the New Æon. 

The Sync Engine is alive, manifesting into our reality as we speak.

The first Temple is already rising.

Templo da Agua Lila is our first demonstration site, perched on the sides of a beautiful canyon in the Montanhas Magicas of central Portugal. 

This is where we put the principles into practice, weaving earth regeneration into spiritual evolution. 

We’re raising money for two initiatives right now, first we’re in ongoing development of the Synchronicity Engine and Claude Code gets expensive. So we’re looking for help supporting development costs. Donations will be matched with starting gratitude when the ecosystem launches to the public. 

Early donor will also be rewarded the responsibility of approving new members once we launch publicly. 

Second, this ecosystem is not real unless its rooted in actual soil. 

What is ætheric abundance if the natural world dies around us?

By design, we correlate gratitude and regeneration. 

So we bought an abandoned sacred valley in the mountains being gradually overrun by invasive fire-trees (what the aboriginals call eucalyptus). 

It’s not widely published but the native forests in this part of the world are under ecocide by large eucalyptus monocultures which flare up into increasingly hostile fire seasons each year.

So we cut and we plant. 

Native forests dotted with exotic fruit trees and berry bushes. 

An experiment in worshipping the Earth Herself. 

Agua Lila is the birthplace, the mother — and the mother needs care. 

So we’re building accommodations out of invasives, little glamping biodomes woven of young eucalyptus. 

Places to host you and your family when some day in the New Æon, you come to visit.

When we begin to host retreats here where you can experience the Synchronicities in person. 

But we need equipment, a tractor of transformation to regenerate this valley into an Eden of Spiritual Evolution. 

Donations to the Tractor Fund will also be matched with starting gratitude on the Eve of the New Æon and status as an Original Steward.

The Æon is Rising.

Will you join me in the co-creation?

I need partners and peers to make this happen. 

Done are rigid hierarchies.

If you join me in this creation, we benefit together. 

Because sovereignty is abundance. 

And peer-to-peer is the future.

If we see eye-to-eye, the same future — families living in food forests and supporting each other in communities built on gratitude — please join me in collaboration.

Even a one dollar donation indicates interest, reserves a spot, and invites you to peership in creation.

Manifestation of a new reality is a collective Intention, I need others to join me in making it happen. 

I’ve talked to many of you with similar visions — this technology has already been downloaded to the collective — it’s just up to us to reach out with our collective effort and grab it.

I’m already donating hundreds of dollars myself and half my work days to creating this reality, but I need a few more hands to grab the fly wheel and give it a spin. 

I’m rapidly conquering the technical hurdles with Claude Code and see the alpha version launching in early 2026 if the right partners come on. 

Nothing about this is terribly complicated from a technical standpoint.

We’re just building out a distributed peer-to-peer database of members, intentions, and tokens of gratitude, we can easily adapt existing technology such as OrbitDB:
https://orbitdb.org/

An existing template project already exists for this technology, it needs only be adapted to new use. This **simple-todo** Github repository only needs to be forked and todos renamed as Intentions with an attention tracking dashboard and a feed of Intentions from your community.

[https://github.com/NiKrause/simple-todo](https://github.com/NiKrause/simple-todo)

The New Æon doesn’t have to be very far away. 

We could be living it by early next year.

A living, breathing ecosystem of abundance and connection.

Notifications of gratitude-based gatherings in your area, your own home a Node in the Network of Temples, hosting sacred gatherings of exchange.

Or maybe just a way to find intentional gatherings. 

And maracuja cheesecake. 

**Temples of Refuge** is the nonprofit organization entrusted with tending the sacred gifting economy of the **Synchronicity Engine**.

Membership unfolds through *invitation and trust* — each new member welcomed by the recommendation of two existing stewards of the community.

Once initiated, members gain access to a living network of land-based **Temples** across the Earth — sanctuaries where kindred spirits gather to remember the **Divine** in all Its forms.

Each Temple hosts **Gatherings of the Tribe**, circles of co-created worship and celebration of Spirit — expressed freely, uniquely, as each heart is moved.

As a **508(c)(1)(a)** religious nonprofit registered in the State of Utah, these gatherings carry the full protection of sacred assembly and of the First Amendment within the United States.

At the close of every gathering, a place of exchange of **Gifts** for **Tokens of Gratitude** blossoms — a kind of *sacred bazaar*, radiant with generosity.

Here, the **Tokens of Gratitude**, earned through **Acts of Service** throughout the week, flow back into the community — traded for offerings of love, skill, and beauty.

[How Synchronicities Are Made](https://substack.com/home/post/p-177349334)

The interface is dead simple.

Suppose **you** have set up a stall to give away delicious baked goods. Then **I** walk up with eyes of delight at the beauty of your creation.

You’d love to share a piece of cake with everyone at this **Gathering** but there’s got to be at least a hundred people here, so you’ve got to find the subset who would most appreciate your goods.

Besides, you’re not the only one who brought food — also some people came to the market with other interests, a jar of homegrown herbs perhaps.

You recommend the *maracuja* cheesecake and I decide that’s what I really want. So I open up *SyncEngine* on my phone and create an **Intention**: “Delicious cheesecake”.

The next screen prompts me to attach **Tokens of Gratitude** to the **Intention** so I drag over the one I earned last week for helping my neighbor cut and process invasive eucalyptus on his land.

I save and am rewarded a little card displaying the **Intention** and a QR code which you can scan to view and fulfill the Intention — by giving me a big slice of maracuja cheesecake.

### **🍰 How to get Maracuja Cheesecake**

It does take real resources to keep the **Synchronicity Engine** humming — so monthly donations or tithes are encouraged, nurturing the ecosystem’s continual evolution.

Yet as a **nonprofit**, **Temples of Refuge** carries a sacred responsibility: to **return abundance back to the community** whenever the cup overflows.

---

### 📊 **Fair Sharing of Maracuja Cheesecake**

This redistribution follows the same spirit as our **maracuja cheesecake** example: finding the *most grateful recipients* through a **Gratitude Bidding System**.

Every **New Moon**, notifications ripple outward→ a gentle pulse through the network, “Announcing that *$xxx,xxx* is ready to flow back into the hands of the people”.

Each member is invited to **bid their service-earned Tokens of Gratitude**, claiming a *slice of the pie* proportional to the **time-weighted** value of their tokens.

---

### 📈 **Getting More Maracuja Cheesecake**

Remember that **Gratitude** is measured in hours of accumulated collective attention on an **Intention** and that helping out with high-gratitude **Intentions** will reward you with a higher value **Tokens of Gratitude** and thus, a bigger piece of the pie.

Or maracuja cheesecake.

So if I bid **Tokens** worth *111 hours* and you bid *333 hours*, you’ll get a slice that’s 3 times bigger than mine.

The proceeds are then **refunded directly** into each participant’s account through their chosen donation method.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!efKY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd654f89-af9c-4994-9393-feb4d5837ef3_2166x6956.png)

Of course, some expense needs be spent in order to keep things running **:** servers must be bought, developers contracted with, systems expanded, new Lands bought for the benefit of the community - Temples popping up everywhere.

Do you see **yourself** living in this kind of reality?

Does this feel *familiar* in some way?

Does it remind you of the the ***future***?

If so, save your spot for whatever donation feels appropriate.

1. **Gratitude***based*: all members agree to a common currency of **Gratitude**
2. **Decentralized:** no one is in charge
3. *Distributed because* no one knows everything
4. **Autonomous:** contracts should be written in code
5. *Asynchronous* because we don’t want to be online 24/7
6. **Organization**: relationships are organized harmoniously
7. *Organism* because collective consciousnesses is living

Invitations to *SyncEngine* will be going out in descending order based on donation generosity but even one dollar saves your spot in **Heaven on Earth**.

Become an **Original Steward** of the **New Æon**.

# Água Lila

The ***Synchronicity Engine*** is manifesting into our reality as we speak.

The first **Temple** is already rising.

**Templo da Água Lila** is our first demonstration site, perched on the slopes of a beautiful canyon in the *Montanhas Mágicas* of central Portugal.

This is where we put the principles into practice, weaving earth regeneration into spiritual evolution.

### We’re raising money for two initiatives right now -

### First: we’re in ongoing development of the ***Synchronicity Engine*** and *Claude Code* gets expensive.

So we’re looking for help supporting development costs. Donations will be matched with starting **Gratitude** when the ecosystem launches to the public.

**Original Stewards** will also be rewarded the responsibility of approving new members once we launch publicly.

### Second initiative: this ecosystem is not real unless it is regenerating the Earth.

### What is ætheric abundance if the natural world dies around us?

### By design, we correlate gratitude and regeneration.

So my wife and I bought an abandoned sacred valley in the mountains being gradually overrun by invasive fire-trees (what the aboriginals call eucalyptus).

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ipCl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92d3f227-44bb-46ce-a1d1-7c0901004006_1280x854.jpeg)

It’s not widely published but the native forests in this part of the world are under threat of ecocide by large eucalyptus monocultures which flare up into increasingly hostile fire seasons each year.

So we cut and we plant.

Native forests dotted with exotic fruit trees and berry bushes.

An experiment in worshipping the Earth Herself.

***Agua Lila*** is the birthplace, the mother — and she needs care.

So we’re building accommodations out of invasives, little glamping biodomes woven of young eucalyptus before they can spread further.
